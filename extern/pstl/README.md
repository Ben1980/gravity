# Parallel STL
[![Stable release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-20190429-green.svg)](https://github.com/intel/parallelstl/releases/tag/20190429)

Parallel STL is an implementation of the C++ standard library algorithms with support for execution policies,
as specified in ISO/IEC 14882:2017 standard, commonly called C++17.
The implementation also supports the unsequenced execution policy specified in Parallelism TS version 2
and proposed for the next version of the C++ standard in the C++ working group paper P1001R1.

Parallel STL offers a portable implementation of threaded and vectorized execution of standard C++ algorithms, optimized and validated for Intel(R) 64 processors.
For sequential execution, it relies on an available implementation of the C++ standard library.

The source code in this repository corresponds to the releases of Parallel STL with Intel(R) C++ Compiler or with Threading Building Blocks.
The upstream source code repository for development has moved to LLVM, with the GitHub mirror at https://github.com/llvm-mirror/pstl.

## Prerequisites
To use Parallel STL, you must have the following software installed:
* C++ compiler with:
  * Support for C++11
  * Support for OpenMP* 4.0 SIMD constructs
* Threading Building Blocks (TBB) which is available to download in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/01org/tbb/)
